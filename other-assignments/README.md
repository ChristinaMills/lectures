# Additional Assignments
In addition to readings and labs, you'll also have daily [Learning Journals](#Learning-Journals) and weekly [Code Wars](#Code-Wars) assignments.

# Learning Journals
### Today I Learned...

One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of some lesson learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject.

### Tasks

Each day write an entry in your learning journal. Document things that you've learned as well as your experience learning them. Your entry may contain code samples, links to additional resources you found, or anything else you feel is relevant. We have found a correlation between students who write consistently in their journals, and student who succeed in class. Take this assignment seriously.


- Create a gist with the file name `learning-journal.md`. You can make it a public or private gist. (If you have one from 201, feel free to continue using the same gist.)
- Add a Table of Content that links to each day's entry
    - Markdown links look like this: `[link text](link url)`
    - You can link to a header within the same file (just like in HTML!) by using a `#`, like so: `[Class 08](#Class-08)` 
    - Note that spaces are replaced with `-`'s.
- For each entry, add an `h1` header with at least the class number: `Class 08` or `Day 8`. You can include the date and an actual title if you'd like. Write your entry underneath this header. 
- Write to your heart's content. Write about what you learned, what may or may not have happened in group work, what you're hoping for, etc. This is for your own reflection more than it is just another thing for us to assess you on.

See [this sample](./lj-sample.md) for an idea of how it should look.

### Submitting Your Work

Please paste a link to your gist into Canvas. This assignment is due before 9am on the day after it is assigned (e.g. assigned on June 13th, due the morning of June 14th).


# Code Wars
Doing code challenges offers you extra practice as well as helps you build critical, analytical, and problem solving skills. Working on such challenges can also be great for networking and interviews because solving them gives you specific code problems and examples to talk about. The goal of this assignment is to be ranked at 6 kyu by the end of week 3 (you start at 8 kyu). For submission please also include a screenshot of your stats page.

### Tasks
During the week you will work on completing Kata (aka problems) to better your ranking. At the end of the week, you will provide an update on your progress in Code Wars.
- Week 1: Sign up for a Code Wars account and complete at least 5 Kata (aka problems).
- Week 2: Continue on your quest to reach 6 kyu. Aim to be at 7 kyu by end of this week.
- Week 3: Reach 6 kyu.
